## 🚀 Project Overview
**Recruit-AI** is an intelligent hiring assistant designed to automate the manual screening process for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). By leveraging **Agentic AI workflows**, the platform autonomously parses resumes, matches candidates against Job Descriptions (JDs), and ranks them based on fit.

## 🧠 The Problem
Recruiters at SMBs spend **20+ hours per week** manually screening resumes. This bottleneck leads to:
* High **"Time-to-Hire"** metrics.
* Significant recruiter burnout.
* Qualified candidates being missed due to fatigue.

## 💡 The Solution
Recruit-AI solves this through automation and data-driven insights:

* **🤖 Agentic Workflow:** Autonomous agents parse incoming resumes and instantly match them against active Job Descriptions using semantic search.
* **📊 Real-time Analytics:** A dedicated dashboard for recruiters to track key KPIs, including **"Time-to-Hire"** reduction and **"Screening Accuracy."**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
* **AI/LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o (integrated via Lovable)
* **Database:** Supabase
* **Infrastructure:** Lovable (Low-code/No-code orchestration)

## 📈 Key Deliverables & Product Metrics
As the Product Owner, I focused on defining and tracking the following success metrics:

* **User Funnel Analytics:** Implemented tracking to identify and reduce drop-off rates during the "Job Post Creation" flow.
* **Retention Dashboard:** Designed engagement metrics to monitor daily recruiter activity and platform stickiness.
* **North Star Metric:** Reduction in average screening time per candidate.
